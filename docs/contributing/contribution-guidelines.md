# Contribution Guidelines

<h3>To get started, please follow the guidelines [here](https://github.com/degen-group/degen-web/blob/contributing_guidelines/docs/contributing/getting-started.md) </h3>
Run the website and test your connections.
Whenever you're ready for a pull request, open a pr with dev branch.
Develop!

Work on your features/assignments. Tests should be written for new features that are added. We are using Jest as the test library, so please familiarize yourself with Jest if you are not already familiar with it. If you need help with writing tests, please ask, as we have a couple devs on board who have experience in this area.

When you feel the feature is ready to be battle tested, lint and test your code and run it through Prettier prior to pushing it. Submitting a PR will trigger this workflow anyway. However, the less we have to do to fix merge conflicts and failed workflows, the better.

Once the branch is ready to be merged, push it to the repo and create a PR to the dev branch. From this point, it will follow the details set out in WORKFLOW.md.
